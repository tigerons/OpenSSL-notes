ECDSA
Create CA Certificate

List and select a curve (prime256v1 is a good option).

openssl ecparam -list_curves | less

Generate a private key for the CA.

openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out ca.key

Generate a self-signed certificate.

    -x509 outputs self-signed certificate instead of a certificate signing request
    -nodes says not to encrypt to private key, if applicable.

openssl req -x509 -new -sha256 -nodes -key ca.key -days 3650 -out ca.crt -subj "/C=US/ST=AZ/L=Tempe/O=SW/CN=ca.demo"

Create and Sign Host Certificate

Generate a private key for a host.

openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out host.key

Use the private key to create a certificate signing request (CSR). We omit -x509 because we want a CSR, not a self-signed certificate.

openssl req -new -sha256 -key host.key -nodes -out host.csr -subj "/C=US/ST=AZ/L=Tempe/O=SW/CN=host.demo"

Use the CA to create a signed certificate for this CSR.

openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 730 -in host.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out host.crt

(Optionally) convert the host's private key to PKCS#8, which some servers may require.

 openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in host.key -out host-pkcs8.key -nocrypt
